# Meepleathon

This Project to to create a frontend application that allows users to access information about the Meeple-a-thon charity. Starting out the application will access Tabletop.events to manage the badge purchase process.


Requirements of the application

* Coded in Angular 7 and the latest bootstrap
* 4 tabs: Home, Schedule of Events, Directions and Lodging, Registration
* Home tab should have a summary of the charity and who it benifits. Also would like a space for donators to the charaty and links to their sites if any
* Schedule of events tab will have a table of what events are being run and when they are being run. This might include links to be able to sign up for the events at tabletop.events
* Directions and Lodging tab will include directions to the venue with parking clearly marked. We should also include links to local hotels after they have been contacted.
* Registration tab will include instruction about how to set up a tabletop.events id and how to purchase a badge for the event. This should also include links to the badges and what is included with each badge purchase.
* The Event logo should be at the top of the page with a navigation bar at the bottom.
